        <h1>Happy Teacher's Day</h1>
        <div class="tag">
          Wishing you joy and happiness, you are an amazing teacher, and you
          only deserve the best. You are the spark, the inspiration, the guide,
          the candle to my life. I am deeply thankful that you are my teacher.
          Books, sports, homework and knowledge, you are the pillar of our
          success and in the classroom, you are the best.A true teacher is the
          one who helps us think for ourselves. From the moment we step into our
          first class, until the time we learn things from you or become like
          you,. When parents cannot be there, it is your children's teacher who
          takes care of them, teaches them humanity and acts as a role model to
          look up to. Our teachers, who have helped us become what we are today,
          play such a big role in our lives. Even during the pandemic, teachers
          are doing an exemplary job by taking the virtual route to help
          students access education- from using virtual reality, hosting
          interactive lessons or even checking in with their students. There's a
          lot we should be thanking our teachers for, especially this year.
